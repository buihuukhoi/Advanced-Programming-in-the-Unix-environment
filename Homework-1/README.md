# Implement a 'netstat -nap'-like program
  In this homework, you have to implement a 'netstat -nap' tool by yourself.
  You have to list all the existing TCP and UDP connections.
  For each identified connection (socket descriptor), find the corresponding process name
  and its command lines that creates the connection (socket descriptor).
  You have to implement all the features by yourself and cannot make calls
  to the system built-in netstat program nor parse output from 'netstat -nap'.
  Your codes must be implemented in C and/or C++.
